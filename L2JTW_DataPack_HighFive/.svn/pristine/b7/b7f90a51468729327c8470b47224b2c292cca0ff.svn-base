Look for Feed Sellers in this area like the one standing next to me. The feed you buy from them can be given to <font color="LEVEL">Alpine Buffalo, Alpine Grendel, Alpine Kookaburra, and Alpine Buffalo</font>. The more feed you give each beast, the more they'll grow.<br>
Remember though, tamed beasts will run away if you run out of feed to give them. So be careful.
